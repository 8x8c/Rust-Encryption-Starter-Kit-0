  <h1>Passphrase Encryptor v2</h1>
  <p>
    Passphrase Encryptor v2 is a modern, highly secure Rust application for password-based file encryption and decryption.
    It uses Argon2id for key derivation and ChaCha20‑Poly1305 for authenticated encryption, providing both confidentiality and integrity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This tool is designed to mimic the passphrase option found in advanced encryption utilities (like rage), but with a focus on maximum security.
    The application derives a 32-byte symmetric key from a user-supplied password using Argon2id and then encrypts/decrypts files using ChaCha20‑Poly1305.
  </p>
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  
  <h3>Key Derivation with Argon2id</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of using scrypt, this version uses Argon2id—a state-of-the-art key derivation function that is both memory-hard and resistant to side-channel attacks.
    Key derivation involves:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Salt:</strong> A unique 16-byte random salt is generated for each encryption. This ensures that even if the same password is used repeatedly,
      the derived key is different every time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-Security Parameters:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Memory Cost:</code> 262144 KiB (256 MB) — This high memory requirement makes brute-force attacks using GPUs/ASICs very difficult.</li>
        <li><code>Time Cost:</code> 4 iterations — The hash is computed multiple times, further slowing down attackers.</li>
        <li><code>Parallelism:</code> 4 lanes — Optimizes performance on modern multi-threaded hardware while retaining resistance to parallel attacks.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The output is a 32-byte key that is used for encryption.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Encryption with ChaCha20‑Poly1305</h3>
  <p>
    Once the key is derived, the application uses the ChaCha20‑Poly1305 AEAD cipher to encrypt the file.
    This cipher is renowned for its speed and security and provides:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that your data remains secret.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Verifying that the data has not been tampered with.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A random 12-byte nonce is generated for each encryption session. Both the salt and nonce are stored in the file header to enable proper decryption.
  </p>
  
  <h3>File Format</h3>
  <p>
    The encrypted file is structured as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Salt (16 bytes):</strong> Used for key derivation.</li>
    <li><strong>Nonce (12 bytes):</strong> Used for the ChaCha20‑Poly1305 cipher.</li>
    <li><strong>Ciphertext:</strong> The encrypted data.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The security of this tool is built on several pillars:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Argon2id:</strong> Its memory-hard design significantly increases the cost of brute-force attacks,
      especially on hardware optimized for parallel computation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ChaCha20‑Poly1305:</strong> A highly secure and fast AEAD cipher that ensures both confidentiality and data integrity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Password Strength:</strong> The overall security is dependent on the quality of the password.
      It is recommended to use a passphrase of at least 12–16 characters that includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-Security Parameters:</strong> The Argon2id parameters (256 MB memory, 4 iterations, 4 lanes) are chosen to be robust against brute-force attempts,
      assuming a modern hardware setup.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    To build and use Passphrase Encryptor v2, follow these steps:
  </p>
  
  <h3>Build</h3>
  <pre><code>cargo build --release</code></pre>
  
  <h3>Run</h3>
  <p>
    The application accepts command-line arguments in the following format:
  </p>
  <pre><code>./passphrase_encryptor_v2 E|D &lt;input_file&gt; &lt;output_file&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code></pre>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>E</strong> for encryption</li>
    <li><strong>D</strong> for decryption</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To encrypt a file:
      <pre><code>./passphrase_encryptor_v2 E plaintext.txt encrypted.enc myStrongPassphrase</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>To decrypt a file:
      <pre><code>./passphrase_encryptor_v2 D encrypted.enc decrypted.txt myStrongPassphrase</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Details</h2>
  <p>
    This version uses the following Rust crates:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>argon2</code> for the Argon2id key derivation function.</li>
    <li><code>chacha20poly1305</code> for authenticated encryption.</li>
    <li><code>rand</code> for generating secure random salts and nonces.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The program reads the entire file into memory for simplicity, then writes out an encrypted file that starts with the salt (16 bytes), 
    followed by the nonce (12 bytes), and finally the ciphertext.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Limitations & Future Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Streaming:</strong> Currently, the application loads the entire file into memory. Future improvements could include streaming support for very large files.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CLI Enhancements:</strong> Using a more robust command-line parser (e.g., Clap) could add additional features and improve usability.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    This software is provided for educational and experimental purposes. While it uses strong cryptographic primitives and robust parameters,
    it has not undergone a formal security audit. Use it at your own risk, especially when handling sensitive data.
