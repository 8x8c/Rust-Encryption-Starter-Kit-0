  <h1>Passphrase Encryptor</h1>
  <p>
    This is a minimal Rust application that mimics the password/passphrase file encryption option provided by 
    <a href="https://github.com/str4d/rage" target="_blank">rage</a>. It uses a user-provided password to encrypt or decrypt files using modern cryptographic techniques.
  </p>
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    The tool uses two main cryptographic components:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Key Derivation with scrypt:</strong>  
      Your password is combined with a randomly generated 16-byte salt. The <code>scrypt</code> key derivation function is then used to create a 32-byte symmetric key. The salt ensures that even if the same password is used multiple times, the derived key will be unique, protecting against precomputed (rainbow table) attacks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Encryption with ChaCha20‑Poly1305:</strong>  
      The derived key is used with the ChaCha20‑Poly1305 AEAD cipher to encrypt the file. A random 12-byte nonce is generated for each encryption, and it is stored alongside the salt and ciphertext. ChaCha20‑Poly1305 provides both confidentiality and integrity for your data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The cryptographic approach taken by this tool is robust:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ChaCha20‑Poly1305:</strong>  
      This cipher is widely trusted and considered state-of-the-art in authenticated encryption.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>scrypt:</strong>  
      Being a memory-hard key derivation function, scrypt makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult, especially when using hardware acceleration.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Password Strength:</strong>  
    The security of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the password. It is recommended that you use a password or passphrase with at least 12–16 characters. A mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols will help ensure strong protection.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Build the project in release mode for an optimized executable:
  </p>
  <pre><code>cargo build --release</code></pre>
  <p>
    Run the tool using the following syntax:
  </p>
  <pre><code>./passphrase_encryptor E|D &lt;input_file&gt; &lt;output_file&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>
    Use <code>E</code> for encryption and <code>D</code> for decryption. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Encrypt a file:
      <pre><code>./passphrase_encryptor E plain.txt encrypted.enc mysecurepassword</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Decrypt a file:
      <pre><code>./passphrase_encryptor D encrypted.enc decrypted.txt mysecurepassword</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How Close Is It to rage?</h2>
  <p>
    This project closely mirrors the rage passphrase option in the following ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It uses <strong>scrypt</strong> for key derivation, ensuring each encryption uses a unique key derived from your password and a random salt.</li>
    <li>It employs <strong>ChaCha20‑Poly1305</strong> for authenticated encryption, which is the same modern primitive used by rage.</li>
    <li>The file format includes a header with the salt and nonce to facilitate decryption, similar to the structure implemented in rage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While this sample captures the core encryption functionality, the full rage codebase includes additional features and robustness for handling large files, multiple encryption methods, and more detailed metadata.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Limitations & Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>
    This minimal example focuses on the core cryptographic functions and does not include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Streaming support for handling very large files.</li>
    <li>Advanced error handling and additional file format features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It is intended as a learning tool and a base for experimentation with Rust-based file encryption.
