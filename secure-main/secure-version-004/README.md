# secure version 004

Version 4 does introduce several improvements over the earlier versions:

Keystream Generation: Instead of simply XOR-ing data with a modified key or layered nonces, it uses a counter-mode HMAC-based method to generate a pseudorandom keystream. This approach is more in line with how modern stream ciphers work and minimizes risks related to key reuse or predictable key material.

Authentication (Encrypt‑then‑MAC):
Incorporating an HMAC over the nonce and ciphertext as part of an encrypt‑then‑MAC design provides strong integrity and authenticity guarantees. Versions 1 and 2 used SHA‑256 hashes for authentication, and while version 3 introduced HMAC and Argon2-based key derivation, version 4 simplifies the construction while keeping the benefits of a robust MAC.

Separation of Concerns:
Version 4 cleanly separates the generation of the keystream from the XOR operation and the MAC computation. This separation can make it easier to audit and reason about each step, reducing the chance for subtle bugs.

Overall, these changes mean that—assuming correct implementation and secure key management—version 4 offers a more robust and conceptually sound design than versions 1, 2, and 3. That said, it's important to keep in mind that custom encryption schemes are inherently risky compared to widely vetted algorithms like AES‑GCM or ChaCha20‑Poly1305, which have undergone extensive analysis over many years.

In summary, for a study or experimental project, version 4 appears to be a stronger and more carefully designed approach than the previous iterations.


The algorithm is designed to work with keys that are much shorter than the file because it uses the keys as seeds to generate a pseudorandom keystream (along with a nonce and counter). In other words, it doesn't rely on the key being as long as the file.

Using a key as long as the file would be the approach for a true one‑time pad, which offers perfect secrecy—but only if the key is truly random, used only once, and kept secret. In our design, however, we rely on HMAC‑SHA256 to generate a secure keystream from a fixed-length key. This means that even with a much shorter key, you get a long keystream without compromising security, assuming the underlying primitives are secure.

So, making the keys as long as the file wouldn't necessarily make the scheme "better" in the context of version 4, because the algorithm is already set up to securely generate a pseudorandom stream regardless of the key length.


For a system using HMAC‑SHA256 like Version 4, a common and recommended choice is to use keys of 256 bits (32 bytes) for both the encryption key and the MAC key. This length is sufficient to ensure robust security against brute-force attacks while fitting well within the design of the pseudorandom keystream generator and the HMAC function.

Here are a few key points:

Encryption Key (key.key):
A 256‑bit key is typically strong enough to seed the HMAC‑based keystream generation process.

MAC Key (key1.key):
Similarly, a 256‑bit key provides adequate security for generating a secure authentication tag with HMAC‑SHA256.

Quality over Quantity:
The strength of the encryption doesn’t depend solely on the key length; it also depends on how the key is generated. Ensure that the keys are produced using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

Using keys of this length, rather than requiring them to be as long as the file (like in a true one‑time pad), is both practical and secure within the framework of the design in Version 4.
