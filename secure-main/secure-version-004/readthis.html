    <h1>Secure XOR Encryption v4</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Secure XOR Encryption v4 is a custom encryption tool implemented in Rust. It combines a simple XOR-based approach with a counter-mode keystream generation using HMAC‑SHA256 and an encrypt‑then‑MAC design for authentication. This project is intended for study and educational purposes, demonstrating how to build a lightweight authenticated encryption scheme while highlighting both the strengths and pitfalls of custom designs versus established standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Stream Cipher Construction:</strong>
            Generates a pseudorandom keystream using HMAC‑SHA256 in a counter‑mode style. This avoids key reuse issues and ensures the keystream is as long as the plaintext.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>XOR-Based Encryption:</strong>
            Applies a simple XOR operation between the generated keystream and the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. This approach is computationally efficient and conceptually straightforward.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Encrypt‑then‑MAC Authentication:</strong>
            Uses a separate MAC key to compute an HMAC over the nonce and ciphertext. The design ensures that any tampering with the ciphertext can be detected before decryption is attempted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Separation of Keys:</strong>
            Utilizes two independent keys:
            <ul>
                <li><code>key.key</code>: For generating the keystream.</li>
                <li><code>key1.key</code>: For authentication purposes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Simple File Format:</strong>
            The output file is structured as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nonce (32 bytes):</strong> A random nonce generated for each encryption.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Tag (32 bytes):</strong> The HMAC computed over the nonce and ciphertext.</li>
                <li><strong>Ciphertext:</strong> The encrypted data.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
    <h3>Keystream Generation</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Counter-Mode HMAC:</strong> Instead of directly using a fixed key or chaining key bytes with a nonce, the keystream is generated by combining a 32-byte random nonce with an incremental counter. Each block is produced by computing an HMAC with the encryption key over the nonce and the counter value. This design is inspired by stream cipher constructions and ensures that the keystream is unique for each encryption operation.
    </p>

    <h3>XOR Encryption</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Simplicity and Speed:</strong> The XOR operation is fast and simple to implement. When combined with a high-quality pseudorandom keystream, it provides a reasonable level of confidentiality for educational purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Authentication</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Encrypt‑then‑MAC Approach:</strong> Before any decryption occurs, the application verifies the integrity and authenticity of the ciphertext using HMAC‑SHA256 with the MAC key. This prevents attempts at decryption if the file has been tampered with, a critical aspect for ensuring data integrity.
    </p>

    <h3>File Structure</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Nonce + HMAC + Ciphertext:</strong> The file layout is straightforward:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Nonce (32 bytes):</strong> Essential for generating the keystream.</li>
        <li><strong>HMAC Tag (32 bytes):</strong> Provides authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Ciphertext:</strong> The actual encrypted data.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
        This project uses the following Rust crates:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>rand:</strong> For generating random nonces.</li>
        <li><strong>hmac:</strong> To compute HMAC-SHA256 for both keystream generation and authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>sha2:</strong> To provide the SHA256 hash function used in HMAC.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ensure these dependencies are specified in your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
    <pre><code>[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
hmac = "0.12"
sha2 = "0.10"
</code></pre>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The application supports both encryption and decryption. The expected command-line format is:
    </p>
    <pre><code>./your_executable &lt;E|D&gt; &lt;input_file&gt; &lt;output_file&gt;</code></pre>

    </p>
    <pre><code>./your_executable E plaintext.txt encrypted.dat</code></pre>
    <p>
        The application will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate a random 32-byte nonce.</li>
        <li>Derive a keystream based on the nonce and encryption key.</li>
        <li>XOR the plaintext with the keystream.</li>
        <li>Compute an HMAC tag over the nonce and ciphertext.</li>

    <h3>Decryption (D):</h3>
    <p>
        Decrypt an encrypted file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>./your_executable D encrypted.dat decrypted.txt</code></pre>
    <p>
        The application will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read the nonce, HMAC tag, and ciphertext from the file.</li>
        <li>Verify the HMAC to ensure the file has not been tampered with.</li>
        <li>Regenerate the keystream and XOR it with the ciphertext to recover the plaintext.</li>
        <li>Write the plaintext to the specified output file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Custom Encryption Caution:</strong>  
            Although this tool is designed to illustrate secure concepts, it is not recommended for production use. Custom encryption schemes—even when built using solid primitives—may harbor subtle vulnerabilities not present in thoroughly vetted algorithms like AES‑GCM or ChaCha20‑Poly1305.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Key Management:</strong>  
            The security of the encryption scheme depends critically on the randomness and secrecy of the keys. Ensure that <code>key.key</code> and <code>key1.key</code> are generated using a secure random number generator and are stored securely.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Nonce Uniqueness:</strong>  
            A unique nonce is generated for every encryption operation to prevent keystream reuse. It is crucial that nonces are never reused with the same encryption key.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Key Generation Utility:</strong>  
            A separate key generation tool could be developed to produce high-quality random or deterministic keys.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Error Handling:</strong>  
            Further improvements can be made in error handling and reporting, especially around key and file management.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Extensive Testing:</strong>  
            More rigorous testing, including unit tests and cryptographic validation, would be beneficial for increasing confidence in the security of the tool.
        </li>
    </ul>
