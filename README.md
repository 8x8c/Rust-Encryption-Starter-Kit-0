## A few simple encryption and keygen apps made with Rust.

Each folder is its own app. The apps here are simple- just cargo.toml and main.rs compile to the exexcutable. Feed main.rs and cargo.toml to ai, it will tell you what each app does. There is a wide variety of encryption/keygen apps here. With creative ideas you can change things around. 


Rust is an awesome lang to make simple, reliable, powerful encryption apps. Each folder here is its own app. Don't know how to code in Rust? NO PROBLEM! Just have chatgpt or similar ai code your Rust  apps for you! Weeeeeeee! :)





The prob with home-made apps is one little mistake could possibly make any encryption script easily crackable. So before a  script/app can be trusted, it needs lots of complicated testing and auditing.  However, if you do not need the very highest encryption security, a few lines of code (any lang/script) that calls on a verified crypto library can easily encrypt/decrypt files. Encryption /decryption is a simple file operation. 


Note:: For the most serious encryption, use an established, well tested app like https://github.com/str4d/rage or something. Then hit it with a round of the OTP method. As such, possible security flaws of both encryption methods would be mitigated.
