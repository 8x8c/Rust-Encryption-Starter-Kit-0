Designed to be incredibly user friendly. 

USAGE:  

aes [FLAGS] input.file  output.file 

./aes -e a.txt b.txt    will encrypt a.txt to file called b.txt

./aes -d b.txt c.txt    will decrypt b.txt to a file called c.txt

The key file is always key.key  in the same directory as the executable. 

WHEN ENCRYPTING, if the key file is not found in the same dir as the executable, it will make you a random key automatically - the file key.key will be made in the directory of the executable. So you have to store the file key.key if you want to be able to decrypt later on. 


note--- this works fine, and as you see has an incredibly small codebase. Feed main.rs and cargo.toml to ai, and
tell it what you want changed if you have any new ideas.
