Usage: a2 <E|D> <input_filename> <output_filename>

xor (like a1) but this injects a nonce into the cyphertext so the same key and input file will make different cyphertexts each time it is encryptytd. 

The nonce doubles the size of the file but is removed when decrypting. 

It is okay for the nonce to be known (injected into the cyphertext) 

key streams have a 8 12 or 16 byte nonce which is a modern standard - but this is not a stream cypher so 
its best to have the nonce the full length of the cyphertext.
